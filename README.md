Healthy Food Ordering System
Welcome to our Healthy Food Ordering System, a comprehensive web application designed to facilitate the seamless ordering of healthy meals. Developed by a team of five using PHP and Django, our system addresses all essential requirements for both front-end and back-end operations. The front-end interface is crafted to ensure ease of navigation, allowing users to effortlessly browse, select, and order meals. The back-end, powered by a robust database, handles data storage and transactional operations such as adding and editing products and user profiles. Users can query the database to retrieve detailed product and user information and generate various reports. Our system demonstrates the user experience of ordering products and the administrative functions of running reports, viewing sales figures, and managing product details, ensuring a comprehensive solution for both customers and administrators.
